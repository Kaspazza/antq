= Antq with non supported Clojure version

As described, antq does not support Clojure 1.9.0 or earlier.
If you'd like to use, please follow the steps below.

== Clojure CLI

Please use `:deps`, not `:extra-deps`.

So the Clojure version which your project depends will not be used when antq is run.

If you must use `:extra-deps`, please add the new version of Clojure explicitly in an alias that uses antq as follows.

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases {:outdated {:extra-deps {;; Use 1.8.0 or later only for antq
                                   org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.11.1"}
                                   com.github.liquidz/antq {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
                      :main-opts ["-m" "antq.core"]}}}
----

Then, run `clojure -M:outdated`.

== Leiningen

Please run antq as a plugin.
Running as plugin will ignore the Clojure version which your project depends.

[source,clojure]
----
 :plugins [[com.github.liquidz/antq "RELEASE"]]
 ;; optional - you can add antq options here:
 :antq {}
----

Then, run `lein antq`.
